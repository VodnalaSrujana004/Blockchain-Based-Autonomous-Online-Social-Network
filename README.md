# Blockchain-Based Autonomous Online Social Network

Welcome to the **Blockchain-Based Autonomous Online Social Network** repository! This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent social networking platform. By removing centralized control, users retain ownership of their data, privacy, and interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** No central authority; all interactions and data are managed via blockchain.
- **User Data Privacy:** Users have full control over their personal data.
- **Secure Transactions:** All operations are cryptographically secured and immutable.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate social network operations (friend requests, posts, likes, etc.) transparently.
- **Token Integration:** Enable rewards, tipping, and monetization using blockchain tokens.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com/)
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (for testing/interacting)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VodnalaSrujana004/Blockchain-Based-Autonomous-Online-Social-Network.git
   cd Blockchain-Based-Autonomous-Online-Social-Network
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile smart contracts:**
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

4. **Start local blockchain (Ganache) and migrate contracts:**
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts
- **Truffle**: Development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline
- **React** (or relevant frontend framework): For user interface
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for development
- **MetaMask**: Wallet integration for users

## 🧩 How It Works

- **User Registration:** Users register through the dApp; credentials are stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Posting & Interaction:** Users can post updates, like, comment, and interact via smart contracts.
- **Ownership & Privacy:** All user data and actions are owned and controlled by the user, accessible via private keys.
- **Token Economy:** Users can earn tokens for content creation, engagement, and other activities.
